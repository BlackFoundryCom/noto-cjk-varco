Initial sources origin: https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk

This repository is meant to demonstrate the usage of Variable Components as a design tool, with Fontra as source editor in CJK fonts.

There are 2 subsets of the typefaces `Noto Sans CJK SC` and `Noto Serif CJK JP`.

The goal is to make 2 fonts with 1000 Character Glyphs each using the minimal quantity of Variable Components (details in the .txt files).

Once complete, we should be able to notice significant binary font file size savings.
